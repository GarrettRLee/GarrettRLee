I have created some coding projects in order to document them and demonstrate my ability to do so.

## Tools 🧰
DITA, HTML, VS Code, Notebook++, Python

## Hobbies 🎸  
I play a lot of guitar, and love to game! Fighting games have my heart.  
I am currently learning how to code, making projects to practice documenting them!

I am working on bringing my projects onto Github, the more experience I have, the better!
